# BearMap – Style guide (draft)

Direction: **hand-drawn sketch UI** (pencil/ink vibe) with **printed text** for readability.

## Visual language
- Hand-drawn linework: uneven strokes, slightly imperfect shapes.
- Light shading: crosshatch / graphite smudge, used sparingly.
- UI elements can look like they’re drawn on paper (panels, buttons, pins).
- Keep clutter low; big hero illustration + clear map.

## Typography
- **Printed text only** (no handwritten UI copy), for accessibility and clarity.
- Use a clean sans-serif for all labels, buttons, body text.
  - Suggested: Inter (fallback: system-ui).

## Color
- Default: monochrome sketch (charcoal/graphite on off-white).
- Optional (later): single accent color for warnings and primary actions.

## Iconography
- Icons can be sketch-styled (hand-drawn bear head, paw prints, warning triangle).
- Ensure icons remain legible at small sizes.

## Layout principles
- Prioritize fast field use: large tap targets.
- Emphasize **freshness** of reports (age) and **approximate** location.
- Safety copy should be prominent but not overwhelming.

## Map presentation
- Pin markers should look sketched, but clustering + filtering should be standard UX.
- Always indicate that locations are approximate (blurred/quantized).

## Accessibility
- Printed text + strong contrast.
- Minimum tap size: 44px.
- Don’t rely on color alone for warnings.
